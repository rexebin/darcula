# Dracula Theme - WebStorm Edition

This is a Dracula Dark Theme mirroring colors in the Dracula theme in WebStorm by JetBrains.

This theme start from [dracula/textmate](https://github.com/dracula/textmate/blob/master/Dracula.tmTheme) and then fine-tuned to WebStorm's Dracula Theme.

This theme is a work in progress.

## Typescript

Optimized for Typescript. The only color in Typescript I kept from dracula/textmate is the comment color, which in my opinion is better than WebStorm's green.

## Angular Component Template

Unfortunately, Angular Language Service does not contribute to vscode's TM Scope, therefore Theme is unable to cover Angular component's template, for now.
